#Multinomial Naive Bayes The multinomial naive Bayes model is typically used for discrete counts. E.g., if we have a text classification problem, we can take the idea of bernoulli trials one step further and instead of "word occurs in the document" we have "count how often word occurs in the document", you can think of it as "number of times outcome number x_i is observed over the n trials"
